# Vocab-builder

This is a simplistic vocabulary builder game I had built for my personal use. All you need is a Python 3 interpreter, which comes preinstalled with most Linux distros, but is also available otherwise in the form of IDEs, commercial softwares or online compilers.

There is a dictionary preloaded with 25 words (I'll add more soon). You can add to this dictionary (or completely delete it). Just run the add_words program and enter your own words with their definitions and examples.

The game is multiple choice based, quite intuitive and simplistic but powerful in solidifying your just learnt words.

A search program is included with which you can search a specific word in the dictionary or list all words present, optionally with their definitions and examples.

Use this set of programs to maintain your personal dictionary of words you wish to memorize. Play the game and move the words in your long term memory!
